# This file is part of systemd-swap package

# Swappiness: controls swap aggressiveness (0-100)
# 60 = balanced for desktop systems with zswap/zram
# Lower values = less aggressive swapping, better for systems with sufficient RAM
# Higher values = more aggressive swapping
vm.swappiness=60

# Page cluster: controls swap I/O page count (0-3, where 3 = 2^3 = 8 pages)
# Lower values reduce I/O latency spikes during swap operations
# Recommended for NVMe/SSD systems to reduce write amplification
vm.page-cluster=0
